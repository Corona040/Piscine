when you receive more than one map in arg, each solution or map error must be 'followed by a line break'

OK

OK
valid map rules:
	y all lines must have the same length
	y at least one line of at least one box
	y at the end of each end of line, theres a line break
	y the chars can only be introduced in the first line
	y no char missing from first lie
	y no two identical chars
	y chars can be any printable char
	y if invalid -> "map error\n" go next

OBS
I changed can_start() function from solve2.c
There were more than 25 lines
You were using two int variables l and c
Their uses seemed not to overlap
So I made a new int i, and changed both l and c to i
recicled the variable
